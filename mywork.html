          <h4>Installation project Fredericia Voldene</h4>

          <p>The people from the Fredericia museum wanted a new way, of telling their interesting story.
            My group and I, went for a room which would have a narrator that read a story that the visitor chose.
            The biggest part of the room, however, were the fact that it would show the people in the stories on the wall.</p>

          <p>To show a little more of what I can code, I made this CSS animation of a cat that's crying.
